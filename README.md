# Challenge MZL

So this was my response to the challenge I was given.
The objective was to use Zurb Foundation to create a basic html page.

Things I had to do
  - Change the appearance of the site by editing the _settings.scss file
  - Change the content of the site
  - Change the repository README.md using Markdown notations
  
What was the process?

So I've used the following tools: node.js, sublime text, sourcetree and of course github. 
The exercise was built uppon the Foundation Zurb basic template founded here:
https://github.com/zurb/foundation-sites-template.

In the terminal I've used the following:
Installation: 
```sh
$ npm install
```
and
```sh
$ bower install
```

then start npm:

```sh
$ npm start
```
to finish npm:
```sh
$ CTRL^ C
```
So this was my very first experience with all of this tools. Any comments, opinions, hints, critics are more than welcome :) .
